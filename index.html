  <h2>Dropbox Access & App Status</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Calibre View</strong> uses the Dropbox API to let you browse and
    download books from your personal Calibre library stored in Dropbox.
  </p>

  <p>
    At launch, Calibre View operates under Dropbox’s
    <strong>development status</strong>, which allows up to
    <strong>500 linked users</strong>. This comfortably supports early releases,
    TestFlight users, and initial public availability.
  </p>

  <p>
    Dropbox requires apps to apply for <strong>production status</strong> once
    they reach <strong>50 linked users</strong>. At that point, the app must be
    submitted for review within two weeks. Until approval is granted, no
    additional users beyond that threshold can link their accounts.
  </p>

  <p>
    If Calibre View grows quickly, an early review may be requested to ensure
    uninterrupted access as the app scales.
  </p>

  <p>
    Calibre View follows Dropbox’s API usage and branding guidelines. The app
    only accesses files explicitly selected by the user and never modifies,
    uploads, or shares content without user action.
